# ðŸ“—Compressor DecompressorðŸ“—
In this project, we are going to reduce the size of a file by compressing it. First of all, we need to select the file which is to be compressed. If we want to bring the compressed file into its original form, then we just need to decompress it.

## ðŸŽ¯ObjectiveðŸŽ¯
The main objective of the project is to save or reduce storage space. Using this project, we are going to reduce space consumption in the memory or storage. One thing we are ensuring here that during the whole compression and decompression process no data is being lost. 

## ðŸ“œDescriptionðŸ“œ
In this project, we are implementing the concepts of Java, JavaSwing and OOPs for its working. There will be two buttons for file compression and file decompression respectively.
